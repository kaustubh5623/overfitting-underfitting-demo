# Overfitting and Underfitting – Machine Learning Demo

This project demonstrates:
- Underfitting
- Overfitting
- Good Fit (Generalization)

using a simple **Hours Studied vs Marks Scored** dataset.

## How to Run the Project
This project is designed to run on **Google Colab**.

### Open in Google Colab:
1. Open the `.ipynb` file from this repository
2. Click the **Open in Colab** button (or upload to Colab)
3. Run all cells from top to bottom

No local installation is required.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Output
The notebook visually demonstrates:
- Underfitting (Linear model)
- Good fit (Polynomial degree 3)
- Overfitting (Polynomial degree 10)

This project is intended for academic demonstration purposes.
